## Jets Week 4 Project

### Overview
All jets must have a model, speed, range, and price associated with them. Speed is in KPH.
Jets have a fly() method that prints out the jets in flight details for estimated cruising speed and the amount of time the jet can fly starting with full tank (based on speed and range).


Jet.java itself is an abstract base class -- its purpose it to be extended by other types with different behavior.
That said, you will still have a plain vanilla JetImpl.class (which serves as catch all for other models including alien UFOs)

Created two interfaces for specializations of Jets; CargoCarrier has loadCargo() method (which just prints out a message about loading cargo). Jamming has method fight()... just with Jam.

The two implementation classes (Cargo and Jam) implement respective interfaces. The classes capabilities are loading cargo and jamming.
