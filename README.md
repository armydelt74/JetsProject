## Jets Week 4 Project

### Overview
All jets must have a model, speed, range, and price associated with them. Speed is in MPH (or Mach).
Jets have a fly() method that prints out the jet details and the amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).


Jet.java itself is an abstract base class -- its purpose it to be extended by other types with different behavior.

That said, you will still have a plain vanilla Jet class. Create a JetImpl class...pending

You must create two interfaces of your choice for specializations of Jets. For example, CargoCarrier could have a loadCargo() method (which just prints out a message about loading cargo). CombatReady could have a method fight().

You will create at least two implementation classes that extend Jet and implement your interfaces. (The more types you have, the more interesting the project.)

Do not structure your code so that all implementation classes implement all interfaces. We want Jets with different capabilities.
